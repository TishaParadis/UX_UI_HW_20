                I began by conducting an interview over Zoom with 3 stakeholders to understand their needs, pain points, and goals for the website.
                The takeaway was that they only represented a small branch to the main page. They requested a new website concept that would 
                be separate from the existing GDQ (Games Done Quick) site.  Inclusivity and transparency is important.
                
                The main focus is to increase awareness of Frame Fatales and they want to broaden their outreach with focus on Joining their
                their community and watching their main events, with the ability to feature the current speedrun charity event.
                
                I then researched competitor sites to compare, finding that Frame Fatales has more to offer in comparison to the other
                sites out there. 

                I had the research I needed from the Stakeholders perspective so I thought it would be helpful to gain user perspective so I conducted
                4 user interviews of active gamers to gain insite on user familiarity with speedruns and gaming in general. To expand my research to 
                a wider audience I created a Google Forms Survey and released it on social media.The survey was completed by 61 respondents from 11 states.
